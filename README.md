# Seq2Seq chatbot
Trained on cornell movie dialogue corpus with glove 50 embeddings. Run chatbot_main.py


# Basic-Chatbot-Structure (Chatbot.py)
The code contains a very basic structuring of a chatbot RNN network for understanding purposes and the main chatbot is the one mentioned above. 
The code uses the nltk toolkit to aid in language processing such as tokenization and case conversions.
The gensim Word2Vec model is also used here. 
The model trains on a small dataset that can be found in the ai.yml file.

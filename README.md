# Basic-Chatbot-Structure
The code contains the basic structuring of a chatbot RNN network. 
The code uses the nltk toolkit to aid in language processing such as tokenization and case conversions.
The gensim Word2Vec model is also used here. 
The model trains on a small dataset that can be found in the ai.yml file.
